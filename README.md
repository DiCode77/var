# var

The project is experimental, the idea is to use standard resources.

Var can work with bool, int, long, double, char and string types.

var - a way to declare a variable without specifying its type; when compiling, the compiler itself will determine the required data type.
For example:

var a = 10;
var b = 10.5;
var str = "Hello World";
var c = 'd';
var bo = true;

The main function of Var is the ability to change its type, for example.
For example:

var res = 22;
res = 22.3;
res = "Hello World";
res = false;

res = res + 22 + 10.5;

res - double type;
